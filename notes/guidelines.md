# The problem

Delivery of research findings into clinical practice is slow and incomplete. Patients suffer and die needlessly during this delay.


# The opportunity

Every clinical department has a set of local guidelines and protocols which are used by doctors and nurses to guide the management of common problems. These documents are written by local clinicians, whose autonomy is important. In order to write local guidelines, clinicians need to create flow charts, visual displays, and to read and appraise relevant literature. The ICS could help to make this job easier, whilst simultaneously providing a "nudge" to promote the adoption of evidence-based improvements to care.
