# Summary

This system is designed to make local guidelines easily accessible through a web browser on a mobile phone or other personal device. It can be accessed at:
[critcare.net](https://critcare.net).
```
username: crit
password: care
```

Uploading and maintaining the guidelines is very easy - all that the editors and administrators need to do is maintain a dropbox folder containing the guidelines in each category. The folder names and file names are automatically converted into menu links and uploaded every 10 minutes.

# Instructions for using Dropbox

## Rules

- Each folder has *one* editor. If it is you, arrange the contents of the folder as you want the files to appear online
- Each guideline should appear only *once* in the dropbox. This is mitigate the chance of confusion/error
- You can add subfolders but don't go crazy
- Folder/Filenames will become the links

## Getting started

- The best way to do this is to install Dropbox on your own non-NHS computer or mobile phone. That way you can keep a local copy of all the documents in your folder, and make changes in seconds
- if you already use dropbox, get access using the same email address and this folder will appear in you dropbox
- Any changes you make to this dropbox will appear on critcare.net within 10mins but the search index is only updated once an hour, on the hour

(you may need to refresh your browser, or use incognito mode, to see these changes straight away)

## Adding files

- Put your pdf files into the right directory. They will be published online within 5 minutes. The search will be updated within 1 hour.
- Your filename will become the menu title for your guideline. Do not include version numbers, dates, and try to avoid redundant words such as "guideline" or "protocol" unless they are necessary.
- Send a copy of every new guideline for upload to the intranet: this is the master copy
- Each guideline should appear *only once* in this site. Put it where you'd expect to find it.

## Advanced use

- any file with a name beginning with the word "offline" or an underscore will be ignored by the app.
- any file with a name containing the word "Emergency" will be duplicated in the "Emergencies" folder and highlighted in red.

## offline_DRAFTS folders

- you have an `offline_DRAFTS` folder in every dropbox folder that you edit
- use this to keep the editable (e.g. microsoft word) versions of every guideline that you are responsible for

## Adding videos or links

You can add links to videos by copying the text files like this one:
COVID19/videos/COVID Intubation Simulation Video.txt
These files must end in .txt
The file name becomes the menu item.
The contents of the file become the link target, so the only thing that should appear there is the plain text link, e.g.
https://youtu.be/HDyKJ4FOX9o
