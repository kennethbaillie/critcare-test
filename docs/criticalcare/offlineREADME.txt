# Instructions

- Put your pdf files into the right directory. They will be published online within 5 minutes. The search will be updated within 1 hour.
- Your filename will become the menu title for your guideline. Do not include version numbers, dates, and try to avoid redundant words such as "guideline" or "protocol" unless they are necessary.
- Send a copy of every new guideline for upload to the intranet: this is the master copy
- Each guideline should appear *only once* in this site. Put it where you'd expect to find it.

# Advanced use

- any file with a name beginning with the word "offline" will be ignored by the app.
