oliver.robinson@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk    logistics and timing  1. all communication relating to the case should be directly with the snod.  2. theatre allocation should be based on workload and staffing levels. any theatre and associated staff can be utilised if available. this includes dcn theatres, although the time to theatre is very important in dcd cases and therefore dcn theatres should not be used for these patients if at all possible.    3. in the case of dbd donation, if theatre 17 is to be used, all pre-existing booked cases categorised priority c (within 6 hours), or more urgent, should take priority over the retrieval.  priority c patients are awaiting laparotomy for bowel perforation or intra-abdominal sepsis, for example.  • on rare occasions, the donor’s physiological condition may necessitate a more expedited process in order to preserve organ function. • similarly, on rare occasions the recipient’s condition may require a change in urgency.  this would include a heart transplant recipient who is already under anaesthetic in another location.  4. in dcd donation, the wait for asystole may be up to 3 hours and the donor may be moved to theatre at any point within this time frame. after arrival in theatre, the donor will likely be placed on nrp for 2 hours before retrieval begins. the allocated theatre must be able to accommodate this.   5. if retrieval is out of normal working hours and cepod theatre is already in use as per point 3, then a second theatre team may be required to attend.   • if organs from retrieval are to be transplanted locally, then the rie transplant theatre team would not normally be asked to assist in the retrieval process. the second on-call cepod team may therefore need to be contacted.  • if organs from the retrieval are to be transplanted elsewhere, then the transplant theatre team can contribute to staffing either the retrieval theatre or the cepod theatre, guided by clinical need.

6. efforts to keep extraneous noise in theatre are appreciated. necessary activities such as telephone calls to facilitate organ placement should be done in the scrub area or if possible, outside the operating theatre.  7. last offices should be carried out by the snod and host theatre team once the time-critical step of organs being dispatched to the receiving centres has been completed.  notes   definitions  dbd: donation after brainstem death. previously referred to as “heart beating” donation. retrieval of organs from patients whose death is confirmed by neurological criteria, in cases of severe brain injury. this can only be applied to patients who are on mechanical ventilation, usually in icu.   dcd: donation after circulatory death. previously referred to as “non-heart beating” donation. retrieval of organs from patients whose death is confirmed by cardiorespiratory criteria after planned withdrawal of treatment (eg mechanical ventilation or inotropes).   nrp: normothermic

the abdominal organs . almost all donors undergoing dcd retrieval in lothian will be placed on nrp for up to 2 hours.    timing  one of the aims of organ retrieval is to minimise warm ischaemic time, i.e. the time between onset of inadequate organ perfusion and the start of protective cold perfusion in situ. after withdrawal of treatment, sustained systolic blood pressure <50mmhg is deemed to be the onset of warm ischaemic time.   warm ischaemia is minimised in dbd retrieval, however, in dcd retrieval, organs will be subjected to warm ischaemia for a period of time before asystole and the subsequent transfer to theatre. the retrieval process is therefore time sensitive in nature. some organs are more time-critical than others. the table below illustrates these in the context of a standard dcd retrieval. note that when using nrp, these times are largely irrelevant as organ viability tests will guide utilisation. | written by stuart campbell, kate carey, steven elder, oliver

Infection_and_sepsis/Initial investigation and management in unidentified Infections.pdf,2025-02-18,"initial management of critically-ill patients with community-acquired sepsis and septic shock when the source is not yet identified    sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection    septic shock: subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. identified by the need for vasopressors to maintain a map ≥ 65 mm hg and serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/l in the absence of hypovolaemia.    identification of the source of infection requires careful history and targeted investigations.    history should include   1. recent travel  2. infectious contacts  3. past medical history, particularly details of recent infections, diabetes and organ transplantation 4. drug misuse behaviour (including intravenous drug use or subcutaneous drug use such as skin popping)  5. drug history including recent antimicrobials, cancer chemotherapy and other immunosuppressants  6. occupational history and details of unusual hobbies or pastimes  7. sexual history    investigations for all septic patients in whom the source of infection is unclear    1. blood samples  a. minimum 2 sets of peripheral blood cultures (i.e. two anaerobic and two aerobic bottles), ideally prior to antimicrobial therapy. if infective endocarditis is suspected, 3 sets of peripheral blood cultures should be sent. see ‘blood cultures in critical care’ guidance for appropriate sampling technique.  b. hiv test  c. edta (red blood tube) for bacterial meningitis profile 2. urine culture. if catheterised, csu should be taken using an aseptic, non-touch technique only from the sampling port on the drainage bag  3. respiratory samples.   a. sputum culture if not intubated  b. if intubated, consider bal or mini-bal. if this is contraindicated, send endotracheal aspirate (4 samples). see cap/vap guidelines for more details and trak orders.   c. if atypical respiratory infection is suspected and unable to send bal or mini-bal, urinary legionella antigen should be sent.  d. covid pcr  4. cxr  5. mrsa screen    targeted investigations to consider depending on presentation    1. cross-sectional imaging – consider ct chest, abdomen, pelvis, head, extremities (e.g. if concern for severe soft tissue infection)  2. additional microbiological sampling  a. csf via lumbar puncture if suspected cns infection and no contraindications to this. if ventriculitis is suspected in a neurosurgical patient, particularly in the presence of an indwelling device, then see ventriculitis guideline for further management.  b. skin swabs if broken skin/rashes  c. if loose stools, send stool for c. diff toxin testing and norovirus pct. if initial sample is negative for bacterial enteric pathogens, up to two further samples should be sent on separate days. if immunocompromised, consider other infective causes e.g. cmv.  d. pleural fluid via ultrasound-guided thoracocentesis to assess for empyema  e. paracentesis in patients with chronic liver disease and ascites to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.   f. if immunosuppressed then consider induced sputum or bal to investigate for pjp, cmv, fungi including aspergillus, and mycobacteria (4 separate requests on trak). where a bal is being done for mycology culture, galactomannan should also be requested on the bal fluid.  g. if catheter related bloodstream infection is suspected, peripheral cultures, line cultures and line tip should be sent following removal where appropriate.  3. echocardiogram  a. comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram by bse-accredited sonographer is first line investigation to assess for endocarditis. focused echo is not appropriate for this indication.  b. liaise with cardiology registrar if suspicion of endocarditis and negative initial transthoracic echocardiogram, particularly if patient has a prosthetic valve. trans-oesophageal echocardiogram may be required.   4. investigation of malaria +/- other tropical diseases if recent travel history to endemic area  5. cpe screen if high risk for colonisation. refer to nhs lothian cpe guidance.    non-infectious sepsis mimics     1. cardiogenic shock  2. pancreatitis  3. occult haemorrhage  4. addisonian crisis  5. malignancy   6. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (hlh). consider if ferritin > 5000mcg/l    initial management    1. consider need for isolation and ppe  2. prompt antimicrobial therapy as per antimicrobial companion app  3. early source control. liaise with surgeons if suspected intra-abdominal or soft-tissue source. consider removal of indwelling lines.    4. iv fluid therapy +/- noradrenaline. target map 60-65 mmhg is appropriate in most patients.  5. early discussion with microbiology if recent antimicrobial use  6. if escalating noradrenaline requirements, consider adding vasopressin and shock dose steroids (see steroids in septic shock guideline) plus focused echocardiogram to guide haemodynamic management and assess for cardiac pathology contributing to shock (e.g. lv or rv systolic dysfunction).  7. consider dobutamine in patients who show evidence of lv dysfunction and persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid loading and vasopressor therapy.  8. consider ivig in patients with severe soft tissue infection. see nhs lothian guidance on antimicrobial companion app.    if significant travel history or diagnosis remains elusive then consider seeking an infectious diseases consultation.   if deteriorating over 48-72 hours despite initial therapy, consider:    7. source control – is the imaging adequate and does it need to be repeated?  8. progression of systemic inflammatory response despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy (e.g. development of ards)  9. antibiotic regimen:  a. ineffective antibiotic regimen due to opportunistic or atypical bacterial organisms. consider molecular testing on samples already acquired (pleural, joint, csf etc)   b. resistant organisms that have not yet been cultured - particularly vre, mrsa, penicillin resistant pneumoococcus or cpe.  c. not appropriate for site of infection  d. dosed incorrectly for site of infection or patient, particularly if patient receiving renal replacement therapy. consider therapeutic drug monitoring  e. drug interaction  f. fungal infection  10. if patient has risk factors for candidaemia (immunosuppressed, recurrent candida growth in respiratory or urine samples, tpn use, unresolved abdominal sepsis, central venous lines, neutropaenia, haematological malignancy, renal replacement therapy or burns) and has persistent fever despite antibacterial therapy, measure beta glucan and consider empirical anti-candida therapy while the results are awaited  11. review for possible inflammatory conditions that could mimic sepsis including vasculitis etc. review the history of possible immunocompromising conditions.    if no source of infection identified and culture sterile – reconsider whether this is a bacterial infection and consider stopping antibiotics. many acute infections are adequately treated after 5 days of broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics.

directorate qit editorial board  authorisation date: january 2024 review date: january 2026  for critical care use only  gastric prokinetics in critical care  in critically ill patients malnutrition is associated with impaired immune function, impaired ventilatory drive and weakened respiratory muscles leading to prolonged ventilation. critical care patients should generally commence enteral nutrition within 48hrs from admission.  strategies to optimise delivery of enteral nutrition such as starting at the target rate, use of a feeding protocol, using a higher threshold of gastric residuals volumes and use of motility agents should all be considered to achieve adequate calorific intake. delayed gastric emptying is common in critically ill patients because of many factors including medications (e.g. narcotics, catecholamines, neuromuscular blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers), hyperglycaemia, renal dysfunction, mechanical ventilation, or the disease process itself.  drugs that may slow gut function could be reduced or substituted to aid gastrointestinal motility (opiates in particular).  evidence suggests an association between feeding intolerance, prolonged length of stay and increased risk of death. although it is possible that this association reflects the underlying severity of illness or a consequence of other unmeasured confounders, feeding intolerance may well be playing a causal role.  for those deemed at specifically high risk of aspiration consider post pyloric (naso/percutaneous-jejunal) feeding. commonly seen in pancreatitis, post oesophageal or gastric surgery. these can be arranged by contacting gastroenterology who ca place these in the unit. if there is an expected delay of >48hrs can contact ir to alternatively place these, endoscopic is however the preferred first choice.  nice suggest - people who have delayed gastric emptying and are not tolerating enteral tube feeding should also be offered a motility agent unless there is a pharmacological cause that can be rectified or suspicion of gastrointestinal obstruction.  enteral feeding is preferred to parenteral nutrition as it is associated with fewer septic complications, lower risk of bacterial translocation, and is cheaper. there are several therapeutic options that help to overcome feeding intolerance.    critical care guidelines for critical care use only critical care guidelines: gastric pro-kinetics in critical care  authors: a hurry document version: 1 authoriser: lothian critical care directorate qit editorial board  authorisation date: january 2024 review date: january 2026  for critical care use only  the principal local hormones that modulate gut motility are ghrelin, cholecystokinin (cck), motilin, glucagon like peptide-1 (glp-1), serotonin and dopamine. metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone are the commonest prokinetic agents in current use in the uk.   metoclopramide is a selective d2 (dopamine) receptor antagonist that enhances peristalsis in the upper gastrointestinal tract.   domperidone is another d2 receptor antagonist that increases the amplitude of oesophageal motor function and

authors: a hurry document version: 1 authoriser: lothian critical care directorate qit editorial board  authorisation date: january 2024 review date: january 2026  for critical care use only  gastric prokinetics in critical care  in critically ill patients malnutrition is associated with impaired immune function, impaired ventilatory drive and weakened respiratory muscles leading to prolonged ventilation. critical care patients should generally commence enteral nutrition within 48hrs from admission.  strategies to optimise delivery of enteral nutrition such as starting at the target rate, use of a feeding protocol, using a higher threshold of gastric residuals volumes and use of motility agents should all be considered to achieve adequate calorific intake. delayed gastric emptying is common in critically ill patients because of many factors including medications (e.g. narcotics, catecholamines, neuromuscular blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers), hyperglycaemia, renal dysfunction, mechanical ventilation, or the disease process itself.  drugs that may slow gut function could be reduced or substituted to aid gastrointestinal motility (opiates in particular).  evidence suggests an association between feeding intolerance, prolonged length of stay and increased risk of death. although it is possible that this association reflects the underlying severity of illness or a consequence of other unmeasured confounders, feeding intolerance may well be playing a causal role.  for those deemed at specifically high risk of aspiration consider post pyloric (naso/percutaneous-jejunal) feeding. commonly seen in pancreatitis, post oesophageal or gastric surgery. these can be arranged by contacting gastroenterology who ca place these in the unit. if there is an expected delay of >48hrs can contact ir to alternatively place these, endoscopic is however the preferred first choice.  nice suggest - people who have delayed gastric emptying and are not tolerating enteral tube feeding should also be offered a motility agent unless there is a pharmacological cause that can be rectified or suspicion of gastrointestinal obstruction.  enteral feeding is preferred to parenteral nutrition as it is associated with fewer septic complications, lower risk of bacterial translocation, and is cheaper. there are several therapeutic options that help to overcome feeding intolerance.    critical care guidelines for critical care use only critical care guidelines: gastric pro-kinetics in critical care  authors: a hurry document version: 1 authoriser:

despite vasoactive therapy (e.g. requiring iabp or multiple vasoactive agents) critical hypoxaemia or difficult ventilation other physiological instability any other criteria considered by icu consultant to make a transfer high risk  high risk transfers should only be undertaken when the risks of deterioration during transfer are outweighed by the potential benefits available as a result of

consultant plus ecmo trained icu nurse   if patients are being transferred to other hospitals for interventions (e.g. interventional radiology) but are otherwise physiologically stable, they do not necessarily require a medical escort. this decision should be shared between the specialty consultant and icu/anaesthetic consultant and balance the risks of deterioration, interventions available during transfer and staffing requirements of the originating hospital.  patients suitable intra-hospital transfer by an accp  intra-hospital transfer of a level 3 critical care patient should only be undertaken by an advanced critical care practitioner (accp) within nhs lothian when the following criteria are met:  • the decision for transfer is made by a senior doctor (consultant, advanced trainee in intensive care medicine, post-fellowship anaesthetic trainee). • there is an agreement from a senior doctor that the patient is suitable for transfer by an accp. • there is an agreement from the accp that the patient is suitable for them to transfer. • the accp has completed in-house training including supervised practice and has been signed off as having met basic competencies in intra-hospital transfer, and airway management. • the patient should be physiologically stable. • the transfer should take place ‘in hours’ 0800-2030.  intra-hospital transfer by an accp is not appropriate in the following circumstances:  • the presence of severe cardiovascular instability (e.g. > 20 ml/hour single strength noradrenaline). • high oxygen requirement (e.g. fi02 > 0.5) • known or anticipated difficult intubation. • patients with significant intracranial hypertension. • any other anticipated significant difficulty.  key points when undertaking transfers  1. resuscitate and stabilise patients prior to transfer  2. aagbi minimum standards of monitoring should be adhered to including the use of continuous waveform capnography when a patient is invasively ventilated 3. a record of observations should be maintained using an nhs lothian anaesthetic chart 4. use the checklist in this guideline to safely prepare for transfer 5. patients should be securely strapped to the transfer trolley by means of a 5-point harness (or similar).  6. reassurance, sedation, analgesia and anti-emetics should be provided as required to reduce patient discomfort and distress 7. all portable equipment must be securely stowed to reduce the risk of injury in the event of an accident. seatbelts should be worn in the ambulance.  key points for the receiving centre  1. once a patient has been accepted by a receiving unit, the bed must be kept available to receive the patient until the patient arrives or until the transfer is stood down. this is particularly true of repatriations (including those from overseas) when the patient may be travelling long distances and there may be logistical delays in the transfer process. 2. repatriation of patients from specialist centres back to their referring centres once they no longer require specialist care should occur within 48 hours of the patient being identified as suitable for repatriation.     transfer checklist  1. preparation  o identify destination, duration, timing o identify senior contact number for issues o ambulance request 30 mins prior to departure – phone 0845 6023999 and ensure ambulance can take cct6 trolley  2.

odp  intrahospital: as above, or appropriately trained accp plus icu nurse (see below)  high high risk airway refractory shock or haemodynamic instability despite vasoactive therapy (e.g. requiring iabp or multiple vasoactive agents) critical hypoxaemia or difficult ventilation other physiological instability any other criteria considered by icu consultant to make a transfer high risk  high risk transfers should only be undertaken when the risks of deterioration during transfer are outweighed by the potential benefits available as a result of the transfer   intensive care consultant, anaesthetic consultant, or senior registrar (typically post-fellowship) delegated by icu consultant, plus icu nurse or odp very high ecmo patient ecmo consultant plus ecmo trained icu nurse   if patients are being transferred to other hospitals for interventions (e.g. interventional radiology) but are otherwise physiologically stable, they do not necessarily require a medical escort. this decision should be shared between the specialty consultant and icu/anaesthetic consultant and balance the risks of deterioration, interventions available during transfer and staffing requirements of the originating hospital.  patients suitable intra-hospital transfer by an accp  intra-hospital transfer of a level 3 critical care patient should only be undertaken by an advanced critical care practitioner (accp) within nhs lothian when the following criteria are met:  • the decision for transfer is made by a senior doctor (consultant, advanced trainee in intensive care medicine, post-fellowship anaesthetic trainee). • there is an agreement from a senior doctor that the patient is suitable for transfer by an accp. • there is an agreement from the accp that the patient is suitable for them to transfer. • the accp has completed in-house training including supervised practice and has been signed off as having met basic competencies in intra-hospital transfer, and airway management. • the patient should be physiologically stable. • the transfer should take place ‘in hours’ 0800-2030.  intra-hospital transfer by an accp is not appropriate in the following circumstances:  • the presence of severe cardiovascular instability (e.g. > 20 ml/hour single strength noradrenaline). • high oxygen requirement (e.g. fi02 > 0.5) • known or anticipated difficult intubation. • patients with significant intracranial hypertension. • any other anticipated significant difficulty.  key points when undertaking transfers  1. resuscitate and stabilise patients prior to transfer  2. aagbi minimum standards of monitoring should be adhered to including the use of continuous waveform capnography when a patient is invasively ventilated 3. a record of observations should be maintained using an nhs lothian anaesthetic chart 4. use the checklist in this guideline to safely prepare for transfer 5. patients should be securely strapped to the transfer trolley by means of a 5-point harness (or similar).  6. reassurance, sedation, analgesia and anti-emetics should be provided as required to reduce patient discomfort and distress 7. all portable equipment must be securely stowed to reduce the risk of injury in the event of an accident. seatbelts should be worn in the ambulance.  key points for the receiving centre  1. once a patient has been accepted by a receiving unit, the bed must be kept available to receive the patient until the patient arrives or until the transfer is stood down. this is particularly true of repatriations (including those from overseas) when the patient may be travelling long distances and there may be logistical delays in the transfer process. 2. repatriation of patients from specialist centres back to their referring centres once they no longer require specialist care should occur within 48 hours of the patient being identified as suitable for repatriation.     transfer checklist  1. preparation  o identify destination, duration, timing o identify senior contact number for issues o ambulance request 30 mins prior to departure – phone 0845 6023999 and ensure ambulance can take cct6 trolley  2. assessment  airway   o patent or secured by intubation o intubation grade o ett size and length at teeth o stop feed  o aspirate ng – cap off or bag o c spine   breathing o auscultation o spo2, etco2 o ventilator settings: tv, rr fio2, peep o ventilator mode simv/psv/vc o chest drains o review abg o tracheostomy box  circulation o apply monitoring: hr, nibp +/-iabp o iv access x 2 (1 can be cvc) o ensure cvc/arterial line secure o treat hypovolaemia prior to transfer o rationalise infusions o requirements for blood products o check hb, lactate, coag  neurology o gcs + pupils o appropriate sedation +/- paralysis o temperature o seizure control o review bm + electrolytes o pain assessment o if brain-injured patient: head up 20-30° + neuroprotective ventilation  3. equipment  immediately available o airway: ambu-bag, facemask, c-circuit, laedal suction unit o transfer bag o consider spare oxylog battery for long transfers  drugs o oxygen o neuromuscular blockers o infusions (twice anticipated need) hypnotics (propofol/opioids) vasopressors (change to syringe)  emergency drugs drawn up  o ephedrine/metaraminol/adrenaline o atropine  raised icp? o mannitol 20%/hypertonic nacl  4. packaging  o transfer onto cct6 transfer trolley o transfer to oxylog3000 ventilator early ensure ventilation adequate with abg  ensure tubing secure  o use vacuum mattress for long journeys o warm blanket o secure patient with 5-point harness  5. final departure checks  o check patient and airway secure o identify emergency iv access  o check monitors visible o check infusions full o patient notes and transfer chart o nok aware o base team to call ahead as you leave  6. transfer to ambulance  o attach to ambulance oxygen supply o attach to ambulance power supply  o recheck patient secure and airway

use. please consult the icu pharmacist prior to starting antiviral therapy if the patient is severely immunocompromised or pregnant.    current national guidance advises that all adults hospitalised with a diagnosis of influenza should receive a neuraminidase inhibitor(i.e.oseltamivir or zanamivir) the limited evidence is strongest for delivering this in the first 48 hours. where possible, patients should be included in randomised controlled trials.   inhaled zanamivir has no utility in critical care, as it is not well-absorbed from the respiratory tract to suitable systemic concentrations. iv zanamivir no longer needs to be prescribed on a named patient basis.  special considerations for antiviral therapy  • patients with renal dysfunction require altered dosing of both enteral oseltamivir or iv zanamivir. guidance for oseltamivir and zanamivir dosing can be found in the drugs folder of the icu guidelines.  • patients with significant immunocompromise should receive neuraminidase inhibitors in line with the above standard protocol and dosage unless the dominant circulating influenza strain at the time has a higher risk of oseltamivir resistance. in this case, use intravenous zanamivir in critical care as a first line agent.   • pregnant patients in critical care with influenza can have oral/ng oseltamivir in line with the above guidance. if a pregnant patient in critical care requires intravenous zanamivir, this should be discussed with a local infection specialist.   antiviral resistance infections with antiviral resistant influenza can occur in any patient, but are more likely in the following groups:  • severely immunocompromised • acute illness developed while taking antiviral prophylaxis • contact with known resistant cases • patients experiencing changes of antiviral therapy, especially if gaps between therapies • clinical deterioration while receiving antiviral therapy  viral mutations conferring resistance to both oseltamivir and zanamivir can occur in influenza a(h1n1)pdm09, a(h3n2), and b infections. if oseltamivir resistance is suspected, consider switching to intravenous zanamivir. if zanamivir resistance is suspected, do not switch to oseltamivir as there is significant likelihood of resistance to both medications.   corticosteroids the use of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is not recommended for management of influenza in critical care. corticosteroids should not be withheld if there is any other indication (eg adrenal insufficiency, refractory septic shock).   common complications of influenza infection  bacterial infection bacterial superinfection is very common in critical influenza. in the event of clinical deterioration, a co-infection should be suspected, and repeat respiratory samples (preferably via bal) should be taken.    these may occur concurrently with influenza infection or after clearing of the virus. common causes are streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae. invasive group a strep and neisseria meningitidis are also recognised complications.   fungal infection invasive aspergillosis is the most common form of fungal co-infection with influenza. this most commonly presents as pulmonary aspergillosis, however tracheobronchitis and extra-pulmonary disseminated disease may also occur. a bal or blood sample should be sent for detection of aspergillus antigen olm asplfd to detect this. empirical antifungal therapy according to local guidance should be started before samples are resulted if clinical suspicion is high.   special circumstances  pregnancy pregnant patients are at particular risk of severe respiratory failure in influenza. see the above section on antiviral therapy for specific guidance on use in pregnant patients.  these patients are at increased risk of premature labour and should have regular monitoring for pv bleeding or ruptured membranes.  immunocompromise the absence of fever, myalgia, or cough is common in transplant patients.  if infected with a circulating strain at higher risk of oseltamivir resistance (eg influenza a h1n1) then such patients should be started on iv zanamivir as first line therapy. if not, oral/ng oseltamivir is an acceptable first line.  co-infection with other viruses, bacterial, or fungal is more common in the immunocompromised. a high index of suspicion for co-infection should be maintained if a patient is not responding as expected to routine intervention. if these patients do contract invasive aspergillosis, any immunosuppressants being received
